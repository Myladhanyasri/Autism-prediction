# Autism Prediction

Autism prediction uses machine learning models to identify early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and personal data. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis through accurate, data-driven classification.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early detection plays a critical role in providing timely intervention. This project uses various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of ASD from a given set of features.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Family history
- Behavioral patterns
- Screening test results

**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Autism Screening Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autism+Screening+Adult)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🧪 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## 📈 Results

The models were compared to find the best performer in terms of predictive accuracy and reliability. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and performance graphs are included to support the evaluation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Myladhanyasri/Autism-prediction
   cd Autism-prediction
2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate models.**
